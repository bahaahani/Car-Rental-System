# Announcing

Announcing the project is one of the most important things that need to be done in our open source project and it's a crucial step in the process of making our open-source project known to the public. It involves carefully planning and executing the announcement to ensure maximum visibility and reach. We have set up the announcement pages on our project's home site, and it will be prominently displayed on the first pages of our project. Although this announcement is specifically for a course project and not intended for the public, it includes keywords and phrases to help people find our project in search engines.

### Announcement example:
